# Good READMEGenerator

##Description
In this assignment, I created the notorious README Generator. When user is prompted for information, then a quality README markdown file is generated. The markdown file, also known as 'md' is created by using a command line app. When the user enters the information with said sections, the information is added to the sections of the README.
